## 1. Introduction
(Provide an overview of the project, objectives, and brief summary of the IR system.)

---

## 2. Functionality of the Program
(Describe the functionality of each component in the system: preprocessing, indexing, retrieval, and ranking.)

---

## 3. How to Run the Program
(Step-by-step guide to setting up the environment, running the scripts, and obtaining results.)

---

## 4. Algorithms, Data Structures, and Optimizations
- **Preprocessing:** (Explain tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and any optimizations.)
- **Indexing:** (Describe the inverted index structure and storage.)
- **Retrieval & Ranking:** (Explain cosine similarity or BM25 ranking method.)

---

## 5. Vocabulary Statistics
- **Vocabulary Size:** (Provide the total count of unique tokens.)
- **Sample of 100 Tokens:** (List a random selection of 100 words.)

---

## 6. Query Results & Discussion
- **First 10 Answers for First 2 Queries:** (Present ranked results for sample queries.)
- **Discussion:** (Compare retrieval effectiveness for different query formulations: title-only vs. full-text queries.)

---

## 7. Mean Average Precision (MAP) Score
(Present MAP score computed using `trec_eval` and interpret the results.)
